            located in an area known for vineyards and
            vacation cabins, which are more and more often becoming permanent residence rather than
            vacation places. The area is situated on a hill with a lovely view around 360 degrees to the
            surrounding areas of Sisak, Medvednica Zagreb, and Vrbovecka Dubrava. Nature is all around. It
            is a place where one can feel even the slightest change of weather and color. The task was to
            design a house for everyday life pleasures, with three bedrooms and mini office space on a
            small parcel for which the surface of the house is limited by the urban plan to 10x7m.</p>

            to the quality of this house is a 10×10 m
            earth-sheltered atrium on the north side of the house. The atrium has enabled a complete
            activation of the basement floor, created ideal micro-climate conditions for all seasons,
            connected the house with a small office space and a garage, as well as enabled better privacy
            and outdoor living. The bearing part of the house is constructed of reinforced concrete, while
            the non-bearing part is made of glass.</p>

            carbonized ash, which provides the house with a
            warm, dark shade and sophistication in contrast to the environment and the surrounding space.
            Subwalls are covered with light travertine panels. The house interior is divided into several
            levels of different heights, depending on their function. In the center, there’s a staircase
            that is directly connected to each space from the atrium to the attic.</p>

            dimension of comfortableness, and the entire house beats in the rhythm of modern music and
            moves during parties. There are relief elements on the house walls. We used the opportunity to

            Located in the middle of a bull paddock sits an off-grid home inspired by the iconic
            Australian Akubra hat. This inspiration came about at the first meeting with the clients
            on their bull farm, around 50mins southeast of Tamworth. The client had selected the site
            for their new home atop a gently sloping hill, amongst a grove of eucalypts, with the land
            falling sharply away to the east to a dry creek bed. From this vantage point, the clients
            pointed out the vistas they wanted to appreciate from their new home: “Yella-rock” to the south,
            “hanging-rock” to the east, a unique vista north through the grove of native trees and a vista west,
            over the dusty bull paddocks to the rolling hills beyond. Essentially an amazing 360 degree view all the way
            around.

            It was at this point that one of the key challenges for this project presented itself: how to create low
            energy,
            thermally comfortable home that celebrated views all around. The station manager was curiously watching on,
            wondering what this city-slicker Architect was going to do, when I asked him for his Akubra hat.
            Placing it upside down, I started to explain the concept of the “upside-down Akubra house”. The idea being,
            a single large scale roof form, much like the brim of the Akubra hat, overhanging the house below. The roof
            would block out all the summer sun, yet allow in the winter sun to warm the central thermal mass that would
            form the spine of the home as well as catching rainwater to run the house, all with a functional home
            underneath
            celebrating views in every direction.

            From this meeting, the Upside Down Akubra House was born, a house with a roof that is 2.5 times the size of
            the building footprint,
            a home that generates and stores all its own energy and collects enough water to run the house and treat its
            own waste.
            Living off-grid is not new these days, but necessary in this remote location, greatly affected by extreme
            weather conditions
            including the current drought. What makes this off-grid home unique, however, is how the technology has
            become the aesthetic of the home.

            Celebrating the off-grid characteristics begins with the “humble” carport, although standing at 4.5m
            at the tallest point and covering an area of 80m2 this carport is far from humble. It is, in fact,
            a canopy of LG neon bi-facial photovoltaics, which means that the solar cells are visible from the underside
            of the canopy celebrating the technology that powers the whole house. Through exposing the solar panels this
            communicates to visitors the eco-technologies that are integrated into the design and educates all on low
            environmental
            impact power generation options and the efficient use of energy.

            The specific requests at the beginning were not so many. Their needs came to clear little by little, as various plans were proposed. 
            Since the couple preferred simple and open plan and also they must keep watching their three children are constantly moving, 
            the house was designed as one big space, placing the double-height living room at the center so that they can see where and who does what.

            After placing car parking at the front and laying out required inner rooms, enough space for a garden was hardly left 
            at the back side of the site, and there are neighbor's walls blocking closely even if the windows are opened on the outer walls. 
            Therefore, it was considered that taking a courtyard was effective in terms of daylighting as well.

            However, a courtyard enclosed with glazed walls in a limited width of the site makes the left space tight, 
            thus, the indoor tree idea that is as if a courtyard drew into the room inside came up in mind. 
            It is expected that the tree which will grow close to three children will strengthen the relationship between 
            the family and the house as if the tree is another member of the family.

            Casa Mao set the standard to achieve a perfect balance of contrasts. As you walk through the house, 
            you experience a discreet and subjective dialogue in the middle of elements that oppose and at the 
            same time generate an impeccable compound between them. The characteristics of an open corner lot led 
            the emplacement of the house to be partially closed to the outside granting the users with privacy 
            and protecting the construction from its orientation to the sun. This initiative allowed the project to open 
            itself to the interior and the heart of the house, where the main views are directed to the rich jungle 
            vegetation that surrounds the context. Parotas, palms, and the chosen materiality incite the sensation of freshness 
            within a warm sub-humid climate such as the one in the city, Colima.

            The ground floor contains the social areas of the program. The main entrance stands out for its double height, 
            it is assertively interrupted by lightweight elements such as circulations designed in wood and ironwork; 
            and finally leads to the pleasant view of the terrace, the pool, and greenery around.

            The upper level encloses the rooms of the house, which continue with the same aesthetic language, rewarding a pause in the program, 
            revoking the feeling of privacy, calm, and a warmer closed atmosphere compared to the openness of the areas in the lower level. 
            Sensations experienced when wandering around the house are not only achieved by its textures, smells, variety of heights, 
            and dimensions, lighting also plays an important role. The ceiling openings and the large windows grant air and light 
            flow as well as a diversity of shadows, allowing each space of the house to be enjoyed under the feeling of freshness.

            The original concept of contrasts rounds off with the inclusion of lattices as a sculptural element in the project. 
            These are the incomparable prototypes of balance between open and close, between solid and empty. 
            They grant the necessary visibility without letting aside privacy, and they become an irony for the structural language of the project, 
            in which it was determined to fully expose the structure contrary to this smaller-scale element where what sustains it was hidden.
